1. load data for players from /user/sandeepm/CDHData/players.txt', it is having 6 columns.
2. load data for master from /user/sandeepm/CDHData/masters.txt', it is having 6 columns.

player = load '/user/sandeepm/CDHData/T2Player.txt' using PigStorage(',');
master = load '/user/sandeepm/CDHData/T2Master.txt' using PigStorage(',');
filterPayer = foreach player generate $0,$1,$2;
filterMaster = foreach master generate $3,$4,$5;
joinData = join filterPayer by $2,filterMaster by $2;
finalResult = foreach joinData generate filterMaster.$0,filterMaster.$1,filterPayer.$0,filterPayer.$1;
Store finalResult into '/user/cloudera/task2' using PigStorage (',');
